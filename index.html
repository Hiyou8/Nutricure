            <h4>About Us:</h4>
            <p>
                Vitamin and mineral deficiencies are among the most widespread health issues, impacting millions of individuals worldwide. These deficiencies manifest through various symptoms, which can range from mild issues like fatigue and weakness to severe conditions such as anemia, bone deformities, impaired immune function, and neurological disturbances. Early detection and treatment of such deficiencies are crucial in improving recovery rates, quality of life, and preventing more serious health complications. However, traditional diagnostic approaches often rely on comprehensive laboratory tests that are not only expensive but also inaccessible to large segments of the population, especially in resource-constrained areas.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project seeks to bridge the gap in healthcare accessibility by leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques to predict vitamin deficiencies based on symptoms. The approach involves analyzing clinical data to identify patterns linking specific symptoms with particular vitamin or mineral deficiencies.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project will develop machine learning models that use symptom data to estimate the probability of various deficiencies. It aims to provide an accessible, preliminary diagnostic tool that can be used by individuals. This tool can be integrated into telemedicine platforms or used in remote healthcare settings, where access to laboratory facilities is limited.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project's impact extends beyond early prediction to educating the public about the signs of potential deficiencies and promoting timely action. With the growing emphasis on preventive health measures, this project has the potential to significantly reduce the burden on healthcare systems by lowering the incidence of undiagnosed deficiencies and their associated complications.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultimately, this project aims to improve public health outcomes by enabling earlier and more affordable detection of vitamin and mineral deficiencies.

                About 25-30% of the world population suffers from at least one vitamin deficiency. Many people are unaware of the symptoms that present themselves along with the deficiency. The NutriCure project aims to solve this problem by using machine learning to recommend personalized food and recipe solutions (based on given/predicted nutrient deficiency) to help balance nutritional intake and lead a healthy life.

            <h4>Our Novelty:</h4>
            <p>
                <b>Nutrient Deficiency Prediction:</b><br>
                - The system will analyze users' dietary data (input via a food diary or questionnaire) and predict potential nutrient deficiencies using a machine learning model trained on nutritional datasets.<br>
                <b>Personalized Food Recommendations:</b><br>
                - Based on the predicted/user-input deficiencies, the system will suggest specific foods that are rich in the lacking nutrients, tailored to the user's preferences and dietary restrictions.<br>
                <b>Recipe Suggestions:</b><br>
                - The platform will offer recipe recommendations that incorporate the suggested foods, ensuring that users can easily integrate them into their daily meals.
